## CoF Randomizer

Spawn randomizer for Cry of Fear.

## What is this?

CoF Randomizer is a weapon and monster spawn randomizer for Cry of Fear. Instead of previously known entities, the plugin creates random ones.

## How to use?

For the plugin to work, you need [CoF Manager](https://github.com/2010kohtep/CoF_Manager), which contains installation instructions.

The plugin has a file **CoF_Randomizer.ini**, which contains randomization settings. The settings are made in the form of an .ini file, which means that they are divided into sections **[Monsters]** and **[Weapons]**. The settings file should be next to the plugin, in the **cryoffear/addons** folder.
